# Spring In Details
  
## SPRING introduction  
### Introduction Spring as Framework
It is nothing but an open source application framework and also known as Containter of Inversion Control. It is Developed in 2004 by 2 person.  
It is also used to develope J2EE application.  
How Spring make J2EE application develpment easy ?  
By using the POJO 
Spring consist of a container with a framework. 
**Coponents** is nothing but the POJO classes.  
Creating, managing, accessing is maintained by the container. All the component should be put inside the container.  
**Why use SPRING**  
1. The assence of Spring is in providing enterprise services to Plain Old Java Objects (POJO's)  
2. Applications build using spring are very easy to unit test  
3. Spring can eliminate the need to use a variety of custom properties file formats, by handling configuration in a consistent wat throughout applications and projects.  
4. The spring container provides Inversion of Control(IOC)- Dependency Injectin features - IOC is provided by Spring container. IOC is nothing but Dependency injection. Dependency Injection is one of the flavour of IOC.   
5. The spring can provide an alternative to EJB( Enterprise Java Bean ) that's appropriate for many applications.Spring can also act alternative to EJB. SPring can also implement with EJB.
6. Spring provides a consistent framework for data access, wether using JDBC or an O/R mapping products such as TopLink, Hibernate or a JDO implementation.JDBC template, Hibernate Templte are provided by SPRING to access data from database.   
  
Spring is NOT a j2ee application Server.  
Spring can nicely integrate with J2EE application server (or any any java Environment)  
Spring can elegantly replace the services traditionally provides by J2EE application server.  
Spring provides elegant integration points with:  
- JDO- Java Data Object  
- EJB - ENterprise Java Beans  
- RMI - Remote Method invocation  
- Web Services -   
- JMS - Java messaging services.  
- Hibernate  
Spring is based on Dependency injection flavour of Inversion Of Control.  
Spring includes a proxy based AOP ( Aspect Oriented Programming)  Framework  
Spring does not provides its own ORM mapping framework.
-> Spring integrates well with all leading O/R mapping frameworks like Hibernate, TopLink, JDP, Apache OJB, etc.  
its also integrates with a variety of web framework likes Struts, webwork, Spring MVC, Tapsestry, JSP, etc.  
It is an very lightweight framework. it doesnot require much time to start spring applciaiton.  


### Various Features of Spring
### Understanding the architecture of Spring 
### Varioud modules of Spring 

## SPRING IOC
  
## SPRING AOP
  
## SPRING MVC
  
## SPRING ORM / DATA ACCESS    

**NOTE: Spring consists of 7 very important modules.Below are the list of the Modules**  
## Modules in the spring Framework are:  
**1. Spring AOP - Aspect Oriented Program**  
**2. Spring ORM - Object Relation Module**  
**3. Spring Web-**  
**4. Spring DAO**  
**5. Spring Context (Messaging, JMS)**  
**6. Spring Web MVC**  
**7. Spring Core - Inverion Of Control**  
  
  Q. What is Spring ?  
  Ans : It is a J2EE application Framework.  
  Q. Which Module of spring provides integration layer with Hibernate ?  
  Ans : Spring ORM.  
  Q. Which module of spring Provides dependency Injectin Feature?  
  Ans : Spring Core.  
  
**NOTE: Depending on your requirement you can use particular jar files. If you dont know which jar file is used for which feature, then you can use one single spring jar file which includes all the features.**
