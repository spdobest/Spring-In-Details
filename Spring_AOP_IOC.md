# Spring AOP and IOC  
The core spring can be thought of a framework and a container for managing **Business objects** and their relationship. 
  
The beauty of the framework is that, in most of the times we dont need to depend on spring specific classes and interfaces.  
  -This is unlike other frameworks, where they will force the client aplplications to depend on their prope=riety implementations.   
    
Business components in spring are **POJO**(plain old java object) or **POJI**(Plain old java interface) only, which facilititates:  
- easy unit testing in the application  
- Easy TDD (Test driven development)  
  
- There are 2 ways in which clients can use the functionality of the Spring framework  
1. BeanFactory  
2. ApplicationContext  
Both  of the above are containers.  
  
Two of the most fundamental and important packages in spring are:  
- or.springframework.beans
- or.springframework.context
